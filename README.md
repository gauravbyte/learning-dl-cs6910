# learning-dl-cs6910
Learning Deep Learning through the publicly available course content of CS6910.

In this endeavour, I have attempted to solve the assignments of the course, which I have made available thorugh this repository.

Special thanks to [Prof. Mitest Kapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) for making the content publicly available!

To add soon: code for transliteration system
